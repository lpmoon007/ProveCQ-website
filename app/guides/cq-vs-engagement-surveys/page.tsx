        They answer different questions. One tells you how your team{" "}
        <em>feels</em>. The other tells you who will <em>deliver</em>. You need
        both — but only one predicts who to bet on.

              Engagement surveys measure <strong>sentiment</strong> — how people
              feel about their work and environment. CQ measures{" "}
              <strong>behavior under pressure</strong> — Initiative, Applied Grit,
              and Learnability. Sentiment is worth tracking, but it doesn&rsquo;t
              tell you who follows through when it&rsquo;s hard. A team can score
              high on engagement and still miss deadlines and dodge ownership.

              Global engagement has fallen for three straight years while the
              economy kept growing. If engagement scores captured what actually
              drives results, that gap couldn&rsquo;t persist. It can — because
              feeling engaged and behaving in ways that deliver are different
              things. Use engagement to improve your environment. Use CQ to decide
              who to promote, hire, and hand the keys to.{" "}

              The point isn&rsquo;t to abandon engagement surveys. It&rsquo;s to
              stop asking a sentiment tool to answer a behavioral question.
