  {
    q: "Do performance reviews predict promotion success?",
    a: "Weakly. A performance review rates mastery of the current role, and current-role performance is a poor predictor of readiness for a bigger one. Some of your strongest performers are most valuable exactly where they are. Promotion success depends on forward-looking behaviors — initiative, follow-through, and learnability — that a backward-looking rating is not designed to capture.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do annual reviews fail?",
    a: "Annual (and even quarterly) reviews look backward, happen infrequently, and are prone to recency and halo bias — the score tends to reflect the last few weeks and the manager's overall impression rather than the full period. They also measure the current role, so they answer 'how did they do?' rather than the question a promotion actually asks: 'can they carry more?'",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the alternative to performance reviews?",
    a: "You don't have to replace them. Reviews are genuinely good for compensation, calibration, and the HR record. The alternative is to add a forward-looking, continuous view of development — a Prove cycle scores commitment behavior (initiative, follow-through, learnability) from weeks of real work, under pressure, so a manager can see where to coach someone toward more scope. It is a development aid, not a decision that decides who gets promoted; the manager still owns that call.",
  },
  {
    q: "Prove vs performance reviews?",
    a: "A performance review is a backward-looking, infrequent rating of the current role that supports pay and the record. Prove is a forward-looking, continuous measure of commitment behavior that shows where to focus someone's development — the coaching and added structure that help them grow toward more scope. They answer different questions, so the strongest teams run both. Neither one decides a promotion; the manager does.",
  },
  {
    q: "Should you replace reviews with Prove?",
    a: "No. Keep performance reviews for what they do well — compensation and the HR record — and use Prove where reviews are weak: seeing, forward-looking and continuously, where to develop someone's initiative, follow-through, and learnability. Using them together gives you both a defensible record of past performance and a clear read on where to coach next. Prove informs development; it does not decide who advances.",

        A performance review looks backward at how someone did in the role they
        already have. A promotion asks a different question &mdash; can they carry
        more? &mdash; and that is a forward-looking bet a backward-looking rating
        was never built to make.

              Performance reviews are backward-looking, infrequent, and biased
              toward the last quarter &mdash; and they rate the current role,
              which is a weak predictor of readiness for a bigger one. Prove
              measures forward-looking commitment behavior continuously and under
              pressure. Keep reviews for pay and the record; use Prove to see
              where to develop someone toward more scope. You still make the
              promotion call.
