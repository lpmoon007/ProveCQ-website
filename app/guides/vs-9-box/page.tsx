const FAQ = [
  {
    q: "What is the 9-box grid?",
    a: "The 9-box grid is a talent-review tool that plots employees on two axes — performance (usually the x-axis) against potential (the y-axis) — sorting people into nine cells, from low performance and low potential up to high on both. Its strength is a shared language and a portfolio view of the whole team; its weakness is that the potential axis is a subjective judgment.",
  },
  {
    q: "How is potential measured in the 9-box?",
    a: "In most 9-box reviews, potential is not measured at all — it is judged. A manager or a leadership group forms an opinion and places the person in a cell, often by a show of hands. That makes the axis vulnerable to recency bias, halo effects, and the most confident voice in the room. Scoring the axis from observed behavior instead is what turns the guess into evidence.",
  },
  {
    q: "Is the 9-box accurate and reliable?",
    a: "The performance axis is as reliable as your performance data. The potential axis is only as reliable as the judgment behind it — and unstructured judgment is prone to bias and drift, especially in a once-a-year snapshot. The 9-box is a genuinely useful discussion framework; it becomes more reliable when the potential axis is anchored to behavioral evidence rather than opinion.",
  },
  {
    q: "Prove vs the 9-box — what's the difference?",
    a: "The 9-box is a framework for sorting talent into a grid; the placement on the potential axis is a subjective read. Prove is a measurement — it scores Initiative, Follow-Through, and Learnability from real behavior over a defined window. Put simply, the 9-box gives you the grid and the shared language; Prove gives you a defensible number for the axis the grid guesses at.",
  },
  {
    q: "Can you use Prove and the 9-box together?",
    a: "Yes — that is the recommended way. Keep the 9-box for its shared language and portfolio view, but score the potential axis with Prove's behavioral evidence instead of a show of hands. You run the same talent review, but each placement is backed by what people actually did, so the conversation moves from opinion to proof.",

        The 9-box sorts your team by performance and potential &mdash; but
        &ldquo;potential&rdquo; is usually a boardroom opinion. Prove replaces the
        guess with measured behavior, so the axis you act on is backed by evidence.

              The 9-box grid plots performance against potential to give a
              leadership team a shared, portfolio-level view of talent. Its weak
              spot is the potential axis &mdash; a subjective, once-a-year opinion.
              Prove keeps the grid but scores that axis from measured behavior
              &mdash; Initiative, Follow-Through, and Learnability &mdash; so each
              placement rests on proof, not a show of hands.
