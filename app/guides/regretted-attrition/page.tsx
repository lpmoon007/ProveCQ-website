  {
    q: "What is regretted attrition?",
    a: "Regretted attrition is the share of departures made up of people you wanted to keep. Instead of counting everyone who leaves, it isolates the exits you would have prevented if you could — your strong performers and hard-to-replace contributors. Because it strips out the departures you did not mind, it is a truer measure of whether you are holding on to your best people.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you calculate regretted attrition?",
    a: "At each exit, flag the departure as regretted or not regretted — would you have re-hired this person for the same role today? Then divide the number of regretted departures over a period by your average headcount for that period. Keep it as its own rate, separate from total turnover, so the two numbers can be compared rather than blended.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why does regretted attrition matter more than total turnover?",
    a: "Total turnover lumps together the exits you welcomed and the ones that hurt, so it can look healthy while you are losing exactly the people you most needed. Regretted attrition counts only the keepers, so it moves when your real retention problem moves. It is the number that tells you whether your talent base is getting stronger or quietly draining away.",
  },
  {
    q: "What is a good regretted attrition rate?",
    a: "There is no universal benchmark, and any single figure treated as a hard target tends to mislead. As a general rule of thumb, you want regretted attrition to be a small and shrinking share of your total turnover — most of the people leaving should be departures you were fine with. The direction of the number over time matters more than hitting a specific percentage.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you catch regretted attrition before it happens?",
    a: "The exit flag is a lagging signal — by the time you record it, the person is already gone. To get ahead of it, watch behavioral commitment signals on the people you most want to keep: fading initiative, follow-through that used to show up on hard problems going quiet, curiosity narrowing. Those shifts surface at-risk keepers weeks before they resign, while you can still act.",

              Why the headline number lies
            </h2>
            <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              Regretted attrition is the portion of your turnover made up of
              people you wanted to keep. Everything else &mdash; the low
              performer you were ready to part with, the bad-fit hire who was
              never going to work out, the person who left a role you were about
              to redesign anyway &mdash; is not regretted. Both kinds of exit
              show up in the same headline turnover figure, and that is exactly
              the problem. One number is being asked to describe two completely
              different events.

            <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              This is how a company ends up with &ldquo;healthy&rdquo; total
              turnover while it bleeds its best people. If a chunk of your
              departures are exits you did not mind, your overall rate can sit
              comfortably in a normal range while the regretted slice climbs
              underneath it. The average looks fine. The reality is that the
              people carrying your hardest work are the ones walking out, and the
              blended number gives you no way to see it. You cannot manage what
              you refuse to separate &mdash; and{" "}

            <p className="m-0 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              Splitting the two changes what you pay attention to. A rising
              regretted rate is a signal that something in the work, the manager,
              or the path forward is pushing out the people you most need &mdash;
              often the same people who show up in guides on{" "}

              </Link>{" "}
              before they resign. A flat or falling regretted rate, even
              alongside ordinary total turnover, means your retention is
              working where it counts.

            <p className="m-0 mb-6 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              Tracking regretted attrition does not need a new system &mdash; it
              needs one honest flag at every exit and the discipline to report it
              on its own. The practice looks like a checklist:

              The exit flag is honest, but it is late. By the time you mark a
              departure &ldquo;regretted,&rdquo; the decision is already made and
              the person is already gone. That makes the metric a good scoreboard
              and a poor alarm. To act instead of tally, you have to see the shift
              before the resignation.

              Behavioral commitment signals are what surface an at-risk keeper
              early. When someone who used to take initiative stops reaching
              beyond their role, when the follow-through that showed up on hard problems
              goes quiet, when curiosity narrows to just getting through the day
              &mdash; those are the changes that precede a regretted exit by
