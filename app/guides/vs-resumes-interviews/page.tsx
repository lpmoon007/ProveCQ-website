    q: "Do interviews predict job performance?",
    a: "Only weakly on their own. Unstructured interviews are among the poorer predictors of performance because they reward charisma, rapport, and rehearsed answers — how well someone performs in a conversation, not how they behave on the actual work. Structured, job-relevant interviews do better, but even then the interview mostly filters. It rarely proves who follows through when the work gets hard.",
  },
  {
    q: "Are resumes a good predictor of performance?",
    a: "A resume is a curated record of credentials and history. It confirms someone has the background, but past titles and pedigree correlate loosely with on-the-job delivery. A resume tells you what a person has done under other conditions and other managers — not how they will behave on your team when a hard task lands.",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do good interviewees turn into bad hires?",
    a: "Because interviewing and working are different skills. A 45-minute conversation rewards confidence, storytelling, and quick answers. The job rewards follow-through when things get tedious or ambiguous. Someone can be genuinely great in the room and still stall the first time the work stops being fun — and you only find out months later.",
  },
  {
    q: "What predicts follow-through?",
    a: "Behavior over time, not first impressions. The strongest signal is how a person actually acts on real work in their first weeks: whether they take initiative before it is their job, push through hard problems instead of stalling, and act on feedback as demands change. Behavioral evidence beats both the resume and the interview because it cannot be rehearsed.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you test for follow-through before hiring?",
    a: "Use the interview to filter, then prove it. Define what follow-through means in the role, put a genuinely hard piece of work in front of the person early, and watch how they behave over the first 90 days rather than how they answer in a single conversation. A Prove cycle scores Initiative, Follow-Through, and Learnability from real behavior so the read is evidence, not a gut feel.",

        A resume shows credentials. An interview rewards charisma and rehearsed
        answers. Both are weak predictors of the one thing that matters on the
        job &mdash; follow-through when the work gets hard. Behavioral proof is what
        actually predicts who delivers.

              Resumes and interviews are good for filtering &mdash; they screen for
              background, fit, and obvious dealbreakers. They are poor at
              predicting follow-through, because credentials can be curated and
              interview answers can be rehearsed. To know who actually delivers,
              you need behavioral evidence: how a person behaves on real work in
              the first weeks. Use them together &mdash; interview to filter, then
              prove to confirm.
