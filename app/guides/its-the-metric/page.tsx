        Only 21% of the global workforce is &ldquo;engaged,&rdquo; according to
        Gallup. If that were true, four out of five people you work with would be
        mentally checked out. Look around your team. You know that isn&rsquo;t
        right.

            You know people who deliver consistently, take initiative when no one
            is watching, and learn fast without drama. They don&rsquo;t always
            smile in pulse surveys or say the &ldquo;right&rdquo; thing in a

          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            Engagement scores are built on sentiment (&ldquo;Do I have a best
            friend at work?&rdquo;) and context cues (&ldquo;Do I know what&rsquo;s
            expected of me?&rdquo;). What they don&rsquo;t measure: performance,
            applied grit, initiative, learning velocity, adaptive behavior, or
            real contribution. They measure how people <em>feel</em> about their
            environment &mdash; not how they <em>behave</em> under pressure.

            It doesn&rsquo;t mean most of your team is failing. It means the metric
            is misaligned with how value is actually created. It rewards charisma
            over consistency, visibility over value, energy over execution &mdash;
            and it insults the quiet top performers solving real problems without
            broadcasting them.

            American business culture says you must always climb: refuse a
            promotion and people assume something&rsquo;s wrong with you. But some
            of your best people just want to come in, do great work, go home, and
            be left alone &mdash; and they are a gift. You should not be dragging
            them up a ladder they never asked to climb. The trick is knowing who
            they are.

          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            The opposite gem is just as invisible: the entry-level hire taking
            classes at night, teaching themselves, hungry to grow &mdash; and
            getting no attention because of the seat they happen to sit in. Those
            are the people to train, stretch, and promote. Commitment behavior
            surfaces both &mdash; so you stop guessing and start growing the right
            people the way <em>they</em> want to grow.
