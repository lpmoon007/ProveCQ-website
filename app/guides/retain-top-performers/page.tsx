  {
    q: "Why do top performers quit?",
    a: "Top performers usually leave for different reasons than average performers. They rarely quit over pay first. They quit when they stop growing, when the system feels unfair — they carry the load while nothing is done about the people who coast — when their good work stops being recognized, or when they burn out being the person who closes everyone else's loops. By the time they raise it, most have already decided.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you retain high performers?",
    a: "Give them a real growth path, fix the fairness problems they can see, recognize specific work in real time rather than once a year, and remove the friction that wastes their week. Above all, stop making your most reliable person the fallback for everything. Retention of your best people is less about perks and more about whether the day-to-day system respects their effort.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do top performers leave over money?",
    a: "Money is usually the reason they give, not the reason they go. Pay has to be fair, and a low offer will lose people. But your best people rarely leave a role where they are growing, recognized, and treated fairly for a marginally higher number. When they do leave over money, it is often because the money is the only thing left that the job is offering them.",
  },
  {
    q: "How do you know a top performer is about to quit?",
    a: "The signal is drift, not a dramatic announcement. Initiative fades — they stop volunteering for the hard problems they used to grab. They pull back to the edges of their role. Their follow-through gets narrower and more transactional. These behavioral shifts show up weeks before a resignation, which is exactly why watching behavior over time gives you a chance to act while it still matters.",
  },
  {
    q: "What's the best retention strategy for your best people?",
    a: "Know who your proven people actually are, then protect the conditions that keep them. That means an honest read of who delivers — based on behavior, not just this quarter's output — a growth path for those people, a fair system around them, and early warning when someone starts to drift. You cannot retain the right people if you are not sure who they are.",

              Retention of top performers is not a single perk or a counteroffer at

              erode over months. If you want to keep your best employees, these are

              What actually makes someone worth retaining
            </h2>
            <p className="m-0 mb-5 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              Before you build a retention plan, it is worth being precise about who
              it is for. A top performer worth keeping is not simply the person with
              the best numbers this quarter. Output is real, but it is also noisy
              &mdash; a good territory, a lucky account, or a single strong project
              can flatter someone for months. The people who genuinely hold your team
              together are defined by behavior, not by a snapshot of results.
            </p>
            <p className="m-0 mb-5 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              In practice, they show three things consistently. They take initiative
              beyond their role &mdash; they see the problem no one owns and pick it
              up. They apply follow-through to hard, unglamorous work instead of stalling when
              it gets difficult. And they keep learning as the demands change rather
              than clinging to what used to work. That combination is what makes them
              hard to replace, and it is exactly what you are trying to protect. If
              you want the fuller version of this, our guide on{" "}

            <p className="m-0 mb-5 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              This matters for retention because those same behaviors are the first
              to fade when a top performer starts to check out. The initiative goes
              quiet. The follow-through narrows to the minimum. The person who used to close
              every loop starts letting a few slip. You will often see the drift in
              what they do weeks before you hear a word about it &mdash; which is the
              whole case for watching behavior over time instead of waiting for the
              resignation. It is also how you avoid{" "}

            <p className="m-0 text-[17px] leading-[1.65] text-content-muted">
              And keeping them is not only about defense. Your best people stay where
              they are still getting better. A steady rhythm of feedback and stretch

              because it speaks to the reason top performers leave in the first place.
              Just as importantly, watch the ones already carrying too much. A{" "}
