        GWC is the heart of the People Analyzer, but Capacity gets scored as a
        gut-feel yes or no. That blind spot is where great hires stall and Rocks
        slip. Here is how to make it measurable.

              Capacity is not one thing and it is not static &mdash; it is the
              behavioral ability to deliver a specific role right now. Measure it
              as Initiative, Applied Grit, and Learnability from observed behavior,
              and the Capacity box becomes real data you can bring to Quarterly
              Conversations.
