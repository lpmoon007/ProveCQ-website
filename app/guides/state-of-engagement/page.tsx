            1. The metric hasn&rsquo;t moved &mdash; because it measures the wrong
            thing.
          </h2>
          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            Global engagement peaked at 23% in 2022 and has slid to 20% &mdash;
            while companies have invested more in measuring it than ever.
            Engagement scores are built on sentiment (&ldquo;Do I have a best
            friend at work?&rdquo;) and context (&ldquo;Do I know what&rsquo;s
            expected of me?&rdquo;). Those are worth knowing. But they measure how
            people <em>feel</em> about their environment &mdash; not how they{" "}
            <em>behave</em> under pressure. A team can score well on engagement and
            still miss deadlines, dodge ownership, and stall when it gets hard. And
            it can score poorly while the quiet operators carry the company.
          </p>
          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            There&rsquo;s a tell most people miss: engagement has fallen for three
            years while the global economy kept growing. Analysts have started
            calling it the &ldquo;engagement paradox.&rdquo; If the metric were
            capturing what actually drives results, that gap couldn&rsquo;t
            persist. It can &mdash; because the metric and the outcome were never
            the same thing.

          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            Large companies can absorb a mis-hire or a stalled team. A
            75&ndash;200-person company cannot. When most SMBs hand over
            responsibility based on past performance, and a majority of new
            managers fail inside two years, the cost isn&rsquo;t a lower survey
            score &mdash; it&rsquo;s a six-figure mistake, a lost quiet-performer,
            and a founder pulled back into the weeds. Engagement dashboards
            don&rsquo;t catch any of that in time.

              Engagement is like Newtonian physics: useful under ideal
              conditions. But teams now operate in relativistic systems &mdash;
              fast, high-pressure, ambiguous. We need to see what people do{" "}

            When it gets hard, ambiguous, or messy &mdash; who still delivers?
            That&rsquo;s not engagement; it&rsquo;s commitment, and it shows up in
            three observable behaviors:

            Behavior is harder to fake than a survey response, and it&rsquo;s the
            thing that actually predicts who you can bet on. Measuring it &mdash;
            over time, under real pressure &mdash; is what the Commitment Quotient
            does.

          </h2>
          <p className="m-0 mb-4 text-[18px] leading-[1.7] text-[#3A362C]">
            Keep running your engagement survey &mdash; it has its place. But stop
            making high-stakes people decisions on it. Before you hire, promote, or
            hand over the keys, add one behavioral signal you can trust. That
            single change is the difference between guessing and knowing &mdash;
            and in a tight market, certainty per dollar is the metric that matters.
