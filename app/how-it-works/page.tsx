        Real follow-through is measured under escalating pressure —
        micro-commitments, pre-work, attendance, and self-ratings across 7-, 14-,
        and 21-day challenges. That&rsquo;s <strong>40+ datapoints</strong> in six
        weeks. The law of large numbers stabilizes the signal, and the gap between
        what someone <em>says</em> and what they <em>do</em> becomes as diagnostic
        as the behavior itself.

              Most tools rely on self-report, which is easy to game — you can pass
              without ever touching the wheel. Prove treats self-report as a
              hypothesis and then pressure-tests it against observed behavior. When
              you decide who to hand the keys to, you don&rsquo;t bet on a paper
              exam. You bet on how they actually handle the road when it gets
              rough.
