        Every founder wakes up to the same questions: Who can I trust to take this
        and run? Who&rsquo;s leaning in versus just showing up? Who&rsquo;s ready
        to grow — and who&rsquo;s coasting? The honest answer, most days, is:{" "}

            Even the best leaders operate off gut instinct, inconsistent feedback,
            and reactive check-ins. In a volatile world, that guesswork becomes a
            tax — a drag on speed, clarity, and confidence. We call the distance
            between the decisions you must make and the proof you actually have{" "}
            <strong className="text-content">the Certainty Gap</strong>. And it
            costs more than you think.

            The result? You start solving for clarity with <em>control</em>.
            Traditional fixes don&rsquo;t help: 360s are slow and vague,
            performance reviews look backward, engagement surveys don&rsquo;t
            measure behavior, and gut feel works — until it doesn&rsquo;t. Leaders
            don&rsquo;t need more feedback.{" "}

              In uncertain markets, budget is precious and mistakes are expensive.
              What if you could invest only in people showing real signal, promote
              on proven stretch-readiness, and retain on proof rather than promise?

              That&rsquo;s what Prove does. It turns assumptions into visibility —
