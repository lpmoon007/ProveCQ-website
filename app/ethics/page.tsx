              A psychometric or personality test claims to measure a fixed,
              internal trait — who you <em>are</em>. CQ does not do that. CQ
              measures <strong className="text-white">commitment behavior</strong> —
              what a person actually does, in a specific work context, over time. It
              is a description of behavior in a situation, not a verdict on
              character, intelligence, or potential.

            <p className="m-0 text-[16.5px] leading-[1.65] text-[#DCEFE4]">
              Behavior changes with role, clarity, season of life, and support.
              That&rsquo;s the point: a CQ read is a snapshot of behavior{" "}
              <em>now</em>, and it can move.

            This is the most important thing to understand, and the easiest to get
            wrong. A score is information, not judgment. Some of your best, most
            valuable people will have lower CQ scores — and that is completely
            fine. It does not make them less skilled, less talented, or less
            worthy. It simply signals they may need more structure, clarity, or
            support before taking on a higher-scope or more ambiguous role. Many
            people do their best work, for years, in well-defined roles. Using a
            score to rank human worth is not just unhelpful — it&rsquo;s wrong.
