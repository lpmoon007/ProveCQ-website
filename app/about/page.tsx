        Prove is the people-decision system from Be Legendary. After twenty-five
        years inside hundreds of small and mid-sized companies, we saw the same
        thing break in every industry — the wrong people hired, the wrong people
        promoted, the right people lost. Prove is what we built to solve it.

                James is the creator of the Flag Model and sole author of the
                forthcoming <em>Lost Disciplines of Leadership</em>™, and
                co-authored <em>Discover Your Inner Strength</em> alongside Stephen
                Covey, Ken Blanchard, Deepak Chopra and Brian Tracy. He built his
                frameworks across twenty-five years inside hundreds of leadership
                teams — work featured in CNN, CNN Money and Business Insider, and
                delivered to 80% of the Fortune 500 through Be Legendary&rsquo;s
                team-building practice.

                The results are measurable: one $3B client&rsquo;s leadership team

                after working with him. He created the Commitment Quotient for a
                simple reason — leaders kept betting on the wrong people, not
                because they lacked judgment, but because they lacked a signal they
                could trust. Prove is that signal.

                carry the load. Two doors, one house: truth over comfort, paid
